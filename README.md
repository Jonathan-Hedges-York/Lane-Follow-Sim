# Documentation for nav2 keepout package


# Overview

This package is an extension of the nav2 stack that enables the keepout filter. Itâ€™s a bit disordered as files are inserted into nav2 packages and not contained within their own. This document will list all edited files.


# Installation


## Requirements



* Ubuntu 24.04
* ROS2 Jammy
* Gazebo11 (for simulation)

cd to the workspace/src folder

Git pull &lt;github link>

cd workspace

Colcon build
